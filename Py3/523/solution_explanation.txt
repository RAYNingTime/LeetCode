The provided code defines a method `checkSubarraySum` within a class `Solution` to determine if an array of integers, `nums`, contains a continuous subarray of at least two elements whose sum is a multiple of a given integer \( k \).

### Explanation:

1. **Special Case for \( k = 0 \)**:
   - The method first checks if \( k \) is zero. If \( k \) is zero, the problem reduces to finding at least two consecutive zeros in the array. This is because only zero can be a multiple of zero. The method iterates through `nums`, and if it finds any two consecutive elements that are both zero, it returns `True`. If no such pair is found, it returns `False`.

2. **Using Hash Map for Remainders**:
   - If \( k \) is not zero, the method uses a hash map (`remainder_map`) to store the remainders of cumulative sums divided by \( k \) and their corresponding indices. It initializes the map with `{0: -1}` to handle the case where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array has a sum that is a multiple of \( k \).

3. **Iterating Through the Array**:
   - The method then iterates through the array `nums`, maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum of elements up to the current index (`cumulative_sum`).

4. **Calculating Remainders**:
   - For each element in `nums`, it updates `cumulative_sum` and calculates the remainder of `cumulative_sum` when divided by \( k \).

5. **Checking for Subarrays**:
   - If this remainder has been encountered before (i.e., it is already in `remainder_map`), it checks the difference between the current index and the stored index of this remainder. If this difference is greater than 1, it means there exists a subarray of at least two elements whose sum is a multiple of \( k \), so the method returns `True`.
   - If the remainder is not already in `remainder_map`, it adds the current index to the map with the remainder as the key.

6. **Return Result**:
   - If no valid subarray is found after processing the entire array, the method returns `False`.

This approach leverages the properties of prefix sums and modular arithmetic to efficiently determine if such a subarray exists, operating in linear time \( O(n) \) with respect to the length of the input array.
